# Calculator Project
An on-screen digital calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is supportive of basic arithmetic operations and allows for customization of the user-interface.

## Features
- Support for the 4 basic arithemtic operations as well as the modulo (%) operator.
- A scrollable display screen to allow for increased number input size.
- Floating Point inputs as well as integer inputs.
- The ability to customize the UI aesthetics by changing the background, calculator, button, and output colors.

## Usage Notes
- To use decimals ensure there is always a digit before the decimal point. (Ex: Rather than .4, the 0 is necessary and the proper input is 0.4)
- When negating a number it must be negated after all the digits have been entered and not before entering any digits.
